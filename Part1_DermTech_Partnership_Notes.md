## ADDRESSING POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"We sell to doctors, not consumers"** | This creates patient demand — doctors want patients asking for DermTech by name. Model after AstraZeneca's "Get Body Checked" NHL campaign which also sells B2B but runs consumer awareness activations. |
| **"Can't measure ROI"** | Unique QR codes track stadium → dermatologist conversion. Card redemptions are trackable. Database sign-ups measurable. Pre/post surveys for awareness lift. |
| **"San Diego is one market"** | Prove model locally in home market, then scale to other sunny NWSL markets (LA, Houston, Orlando). DermTech HQ is in San Diego — perfect test market. |
| **"Regulatory concerns"** | Screenings are educational, not diagnostic. Nurses do visual assessments only. Model after successful AstraZeneca-NHL "Get Body Checked Against Cancer" campaign. |
| **"Never done sports sponsorship"** | Pharma sports partnerships are exploding: Novartis-NFL (first pharma partner), AstraZeneca-NHL, Eli Lilly-WNBA, Sanofi-Olympics. First-mover advantage in NWSL. |
| **"Target demo isn't sports fans"** | Wave FC fans skew educated, health-conscious professionals 25-45 — prime "ask your dermatologist" demo. NWSL audience has higher household income than average. |

## INDUSTRY RESEARCH: PHARMA SPORTS PARTNERSHIPS

### Recent Examples:
- **Novartis-NFL (2025)**: First-ever corporate pharmaceutical partner of the NFL, focusing on "Crucial Catch" cancer awareness
- **AstraZeneca-NHL**: "Get Body Checked Against Cancer" campaign leveraging hockey's engaged fanbase
- **Eli Lilly-WNBA**: Community-focused "99 activation" during All-Star weekend in Indianapolis
- **Sanofi-Olympics (2024)**: Premium sponsor of Paris Olympics with meningitis awareness focus
- **Vanda Pharmaceuticals-NHL**: First pharma jersey patch sponsor (NY Islanders)

### Key Success Factor (from Sanofi's head of corporate partnerships):
> Three-pronged approach:
> 1. **Employee engagement** — Internal pride and activation
> 2. **Brand reputation aligned with purpose** — Authentic connection to company mission  
> 3. **Disease awareness** — Meaningful health education for fans

**Critical insight**: Pharma brands must go beyond logo placement. The most successful partnerships bring the brand's health mission into the community through authentic programming.
